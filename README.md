React Native app to track meditation sessions

Create a firebase account and create: src/config/firebase.auth.js:

```
const config = {
  apiKey: '',
  authDomain: '',
  databaseURL: '',
  projectId: '',
  storageBucket: '',
  messagingSenderId: ''
};

export default config;
```

run: yarn install (need to have yarn installed globally)
run: react-native run-ios (to see app in simulator)
